## Results Information
This results folder contains dated actions/preference .csv files for each experiment. Each experiment comes as a pair of files.
- Every file here has been run on the ess data, from the European Social Survey. The specifc data can be found in ~/data/ess_example_data

The files are named as follows: day-year-'results'-'factor'-the factor the results were multipled by (to make data more extreme)

#### Specific Information
- 13-11 data is data with a factor of 2.5 and 5.0 on ESS data
    - A factor of 5.0 gives a transition point of 1.70
    - A factor of 2.5 gives a transition point of 2.60

Modifying the way that the factor is generated, such that instead of multiplying each action judgement, it also changes the value of action by increasing the distance between each action judgment by a factor gives more accurate results

##### 14-11 Data
For a preference factor of 2.5 and an action factor of 5.0 gives a transition point of 1.40, HCVA of 2.1
